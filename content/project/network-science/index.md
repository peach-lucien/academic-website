A large proportion of my interests lies in the analysis of complex systems that can be abstracted as networks or graphs. In particular, I work on applications and development of graph theoretical tools. I am interested in all aspects of networks, including their meaningful construction, their underlying geometry, and dynamics that are constrained to them. Together with my collaborators we have published a variety of graph theoretical and network science manuscripts.
