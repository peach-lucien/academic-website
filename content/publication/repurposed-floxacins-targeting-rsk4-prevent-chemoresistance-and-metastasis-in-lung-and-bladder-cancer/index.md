abstract: Lung and bladder cancers are mostly incurable because of the early
  development of drug resistance and metastatic dissemination. Hence, improved
  therapies that tackle these two processes are urgently needed to improve
  clinical outcome. We have identified RSK4 as a promoter of drug resistance and
  metastasis in lung and bladder cancer cells. Silencing this kinase, through
  either RNA interference or CRISPR, sensitized tumor cells to chemotherapy and
  hindered metastasis in vitro and in vivo in a tail vein injection model. Drug
  screening revealed several floxacin antibiotics as potent RSK4 activation
  inhibitors, and trovafloxacin reproduced all effects of RSK4 silencing in
  vitro and in/ex vivo using lung cancer xenograft and genetically engineered
  mouse models and bladder tumor explants. Through x-ray structure determination
  and Markov transient and Deuterium exchange analyses, we identified the
  allosteric binding site and revealed how this compound blocks RSK4 kinase
  activation through binding to an allosteric site and mimicking a kinase
  autoinhibitory mechanism involving the RSK4â€™s hydrophobic motif. Last, we show
  that patients undergoing chemotherapy and adhering to prophylactic
  levofloxacin in the large placebo-controlled randomized phase 3 SIGNIFICANT
  trial had significantly increased (P = 0.048) long-term overall survival
  times. Hence, we suggest that RSK4 inhibition may represent an effective
  therapeutic strategy for treating lung and bladder cancer.
