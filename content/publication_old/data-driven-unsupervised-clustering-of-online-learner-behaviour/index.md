abstract: "The widespread adoption of online courses opens opportunities for
  analysing learner behaviour and optimising web-based learning adapted to
  observed usage. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework for the analysis
  of time-series of online learner engagement, which allows the identification
  of clusters of learners with similar online temporal behaviour directly from
  the raw data without prescribing a priori subjective reference behaviours. The
  method uses a dynamic time warping kernel to create a pair-wise similarity
  between time-series of learner actions, and combines it with an unsupervised
  multiscale graph clustering algorithm to identify groups of learners with
  similar temporal behaviour. To showcase our approach, we analyse task
  completion data from a cohort of learners taking an online post-graduate
  degree at Imperial Business School. Our analysis reveals clusters of learners
  with statistically distinct patterns of engagement, from distributed to massed
  learning, with different levels of regularity, adherence to pre-planned course
  structure and task completion. The approach also reveals outlier learners with
  highly sporadic behaviour. A posteriori comparison against student performance
  shows that, whereas high-performing learners are spread across clusters with
  diverse temporal engagement, low performers are located significantly in the
  massed learning cluster, and our unsupervised clustering identifies low
  performers more accurately than common machine learning classification methods
  trained on temporal statistics of the data. Finally, we test the applicability
  of the method by analysing two additional data sets: a different cohort of the
  same course, and time-series of different format from another university."
