abstract: Networks are widely used as mathematical models of complex systems
  across many scientific disciplines. Decades of work have produced a vast
  corpus of research characterizing the topological, combinatorial, statistical,
  and spectral properties of graphs. Each graph property can be thought of as a
  feature that captures important (and sometimes overlapping) characteristics of
  a network. In this paper, we introduce HCGA, a framework for highly
  comparative analysis of graph datasets that computes several thousands of
  graph features from any given network. HCGA also offers a suite of statistical
  learning and data analysis tools for automated identification and selection of
  important and interpretable features underpinning the characterization of
  graph datasets. We show that HCGA outperforms other methodologies on
  supervised classification tasks on benchmark datasets while retaining the
  interpretability of network features. We exemplify HCGA by predicting the
  charge transfer in organic semiconductors and clustering a dataset of neuronal
  morphology images.

Graphs are used to model data across many scientific domains, from relationships in social networks to the interactions between atoms in a molecule. The study of graphs and networks has a long history, and a vast literature exists characterizing different properties and aspects of their structure. Here, we present HCGA, a software package that computes a large, comprehensive collection of graph properties and uses them as features for the systematic, highly comparative analysis of graph datasets. Our toolbox makes it possible for researchers from diverse scientific fields to easily access an extensive set of graph-theoretical tools to generate interpretable and quantifiable insights into their data.
