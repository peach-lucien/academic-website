abstract: Classic measures of graph centrality capture distinct aspects of node
  importance, from the local (e.g., degree) to the global (e.g., closeness).
  Here we exploit the connection between diffusion and geometry to introduce a
  multiscale centrality measure. A node is defined to be central if it breaks
  the metricity of the diffusion as a consequence of the effective boundaries
  and inhomogeneities in the graph. Our measure is naturally multiscale, as it
  is computed relative to graph neighborhoods within the varying time horizon of
  the diffusion. We find that the centrality of nodes can differ widely at
  different scales. In particular, our measure correlates with degree (i.e.,
  hubs) at small scales and with closeness (i.e., bridges) at large scales, and
  also reveals the existence of multicentric structures in complex networks. By
  examining centrality across scales, our measure thus provides an evaluation of
  node importance relative to local and global processes on the network.
