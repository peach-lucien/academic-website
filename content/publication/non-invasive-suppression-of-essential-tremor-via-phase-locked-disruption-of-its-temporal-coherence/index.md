abstract: Aberrant neural oscillations hallmark numerous brain disorders. Here,
  we first report a method to track the phase of neural oscillations in
  real-time via endpoint-corrected Hilbert transform (ecHT) that mitigates the
  characteristic Gibbs distortion. We then used ecHT to show that the aberrant
  neural oscillation that hallmarks essential tremor (ET) syndrome, the most
  common adult movement disorder, can be transiently suppressed via transcranial
  electrical stimulation of the cerebellum phase-locked to the tremor. The
  tremor suppression is sustained shortly after the end of the stimulation and
  can be phenomenologically predicted. Finally, we use feature-based
  statistical-learning and neurophysiological-modelling to show that the
  suppression of ET is mechanistically attributed to a disruption of the
  temporal coherence of the aberrant oscillations in the olivocerebellar loop,
  thus establishing its causal role. The suppression of aberrant neural
  oscillation via phase-locked driven disruption of temporal coherence may in
  the future represent a powerful neuromodulatory strategy to treat brain
  disorders.
