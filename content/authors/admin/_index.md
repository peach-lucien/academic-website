Researcher fascninated by the emergence of neural dynamics from neural network structure and their role in behaviourally relevant computation.

I develop the theory and build mathematical tools to explore the role of higher-order inteactions and their role in driving non-linearity and compositionality in neural dynamics.

I am a group leader at [University Hospital ](https://www.ukw.de/startseite/)[WÃ¼rzburg](https://www.ukw.de/kliniken-zentren/)[](https://www.ukw.de/startseite/) and a Honorary Senior Research Fellow at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/).
