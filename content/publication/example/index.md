abstract: Dimension is a fundamental property of objects and the space in which
  they are embedded. Yet ideal notions of dimension, as in Euclidean spaces, do
  not always translate to physical spaces, which can be constrained by
  boundaries and distorted by inhomogeneities, or to intrinsically discrete
  systems such as networks. To take into account locality, finiteness and
  discreteness, dynamical processes can be used to probe the space geometry and
  define its dimension. Here we show that each point in space can be assigned a
  relative dimension with respect to the source of a diffusive process, a
  concept that provides a scale-dependent definition for local and global
  dimension also applicable to networks. To showcase its application to physical
  systems, we demonstrate that the local dimension of structural protein graphs
  correlates with structural flexibility, and the relative dimension with
  respect to the active site uncovers regions involved in allosteric
  communication. In simple models of epidemics on networks, the relative
  dimension is predictive of the spreading capability of nodes, and identifies
  scales at which the graph structure is predictive of infectivity. We further
  apply our dimension measures to neuronal networks, economic trade, social
  networks, ocean flows, and to the comparison of random graphs.

summary: "Dimension is a fundamental property of the spaces in which objects are
  embedded, but even when a natural embedding does not exist, there are still
  meaningful notions of dimension that can be derived from the intrinsic
  geometrical properties of the object itself.  "
