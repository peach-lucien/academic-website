abstract: Hospitals constitute highly interconnected systems that bring into
  contact an abundance of infectious pathogens and susceptible individuals, thus
  making infection outbreaks both common and challenging. In recent years, there
  has been a sharp incidence of antimicrobial-resistance amongst
  healthcare-associated infections, a situation now considered endemic in many
  countries. Here we present network-based analyses of a data set capturing the
  movement of patients harbouring antibiotic-resistant bacteria across three
  large London hospitals. We show that there are substantial memory effects in
  the movement of hospital patients colonised with antibiotic-resistant
  bacteria. Such memory effects break first-order Markovian transitive
  assumptions and substantially alter the conclusions from the analysis,
  specifically on node rankings and the evolution of diffusive processes. We
  capture variable length memory effects by constructing a lumped-state memory
  network, which we then use to identify individually import wards and
  overlapping communities of wards. We find these wards align closely to known
  hotspots of transmission and commonly followed pathways patients. Our
  framework provides a means to focus infection control efforts and cohort
  outbreaks of healthcare-associated infections.
