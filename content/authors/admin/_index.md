Researcher working on machine learning approaches to investigate and construct complex networks at [University Hospital Wurzburg](https://www.ukw.de/startseite/) and [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). 

Currently, in my postdoc I am focused on understanding the higher-order non-linear mechanisms that underpin brain dynamics and its role in health and disease.
