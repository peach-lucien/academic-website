abstract: Mental health is a growing public health issue that requires a
  large-scale response that cannot be met with only traditional services. While
  digital tools are proliferating, most are not evaluated, and we know little
  about their users and their needs. Shout is a free mental health text
  messaging service run by the charity Mental Health Innovations that provides
  support for individuals in the United Kingdom experiencing mental or emotional
  distress and seeking help. The Shout dataset includes anonymised text message
  conversations and post-conversation surveys, providing a unique and valuable
  opportunity to hear at scale from those experiencing distress. This data
  offers the potential to better understand mental health needs, particularly
  for people not using traditional mental health services, and to evaluate the
  impact of a novel form of crisis support. In this paper, we use natural
  language processing (NLP) to gain insight into the demographic groups that are
  using the Shout service, their behavioural expressions of distress
  (behaviours), and to assess Shout Volunteer's adherence to the conversation
  techniques and formats they are taught (conversation stages). We report
  accurate classification of texter demographics (96%), behaviours (1-hamming
  loss = 95%) and conversation stages (88%), exemplifying the capabilities of
  NLP applied to frontline mental health datasets to offer insight into the
  experiences of those using digital mental health services and the quality of
  service provision.
