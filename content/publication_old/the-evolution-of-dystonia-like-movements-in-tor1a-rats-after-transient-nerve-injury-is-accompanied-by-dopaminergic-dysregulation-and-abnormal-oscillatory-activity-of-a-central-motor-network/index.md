abstract: TOR1A is the most common inherited form of dystonia with still unclear
  pathophysiology and reduced penetrance of 30–40%. ∆ETorA rats mimic the TOR1A
  disease by expression of the human TOR1A mutation without presenting a
  dystonic phenotype. We aimed to induce dystonia-like symptoms in male ∆ETorA
  rats by peripheral nerve injury and to identify central mechanism of dystonia
  development. Dystonia-like movements (DLM) were assessed using the tail
  suspension test and implementing a pipeline of deep learning applications.
  Neuron numbers of striatal parvalbumin+, nNOS+, calretinin+, ChAT+
  interneurons and Nissl+ cells were estimated by unbiased stereology. Striatal
  dopaminergic metabolism was analyzed via in vivo microdialysis, qPCR and
  western blot. Local field potentials (LFP) were recorded from the central
  motor network. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the entopeduncular nucleus (EP)
  was performed. Nerve-injured ∆ETorA rats developed long-lasting DLM over 12
  weeks. No changes in striatal structure were observed. Dystonic-like ∆ETorA
  rats presented a higher striatal dopaminergic turnover and stimulus-induced
  elevation of dopamine efflux compared to the control groups. Higher LFP theta
  power in the EP of dystonic-like ∆ETorA compared to wt rats was recorded.
  Chronic EP-DBS over 3 weeks led to improvement of DLM. Our data emphasizes the
  role of environmental factors in TOR1A symptomatogenesis. LFP analyses
  indicate that the pathologically enhanced theta power is a physiomarker of
  DLM. This TOR1A model replicates key features of the human TOR1A pathology on
  multiple biological levels and is therefore suited for further analysis of
  dystonia pathomechanism.
